## Motivation
As a developer who loves to play Squad, I'm often reaching for Squad Map and Layer data to use in my own applications. The aim of this repository is to centralise that data into a single repository to make it easier to maintain and keep up-to-date. I have made this public to assist others in the same way!

## Data Source
The data stored in this repository is sourced from the [Server Configuration Page](https://squad.gamepedia.com/Server_Configuration#Map_Rotation_in_MapRotation.cfg) on [Squad Wiki](https://squad.gamepedia.com/Squad_Wiki).

Further additions may have been made to the data sourced. In some cases, these additions may be based on personal opinions of the people that contribute to this repository, such as player count limits. If you believe that these additional pieces of data, or any data stored here, is incorrect, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/Thomas-Smyth/squad-maps/issues) so it can be discussed.

## Contributing
Feel free to help keep this repository up-to-date with Squad!

The aim of this repository is to provide easy access to data that often comes in useful when developing applications related to Squad. Though we want this data to be in-depth enough to meet developer's requirements, we do not want to bloat the repository with too much data. If you wish to add additional types of data then we suggest you make an issue first proposing the additions.
