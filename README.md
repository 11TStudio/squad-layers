## Motivation
As a developer who loves to play Squad, I'm often reaching for Squad Map and Layer data to use in my own applications. The aim of this repository is to centralise that data into a single repository to make it easier to maintain and keep up-to-date. I have made this public to assist others in the same way!

## Data Source
The data stored in this repository is sourced from the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ej4vcnOAAGWGRoUlwQSPa8jM9wMaN7pH7lSLf2ery_A) of layers that OWI now releases with every new release.

Further additions have been derived from this data, in particular, an estimate of the min and max player count suitable for each layer. This is still very experimental, so feedback via issues would be appreciated.

## Contributing
The updating process of this repository has been automated, so little contributions are required in that regard. However, if you wish to contribute to the information we derive from the layer data supplied by OWI then feel free to make an issue or pull request with your suggestions.
